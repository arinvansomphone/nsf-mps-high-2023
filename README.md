Working with UCLA professors Dr. Hua Zhou and Dr. Jin Zhou, as well as graduate students Jonathan Hori and Tomoki Okuno, this project features all of my progress in constructing a dynamic predictions model for cardiovascular disease survival probabilities.

The data we worked with is from the ACCORD study dataset (not publicly available), which contains cardiovascular biomarkers such as hba1c, 1,5 AG, and blood pressure. We used these metrics with linear mixed and cox proportional hazard models to output a survival probability for each patient.
